# Welcome to Cumulus Weather App !

Hi! I'm a weather giving application, developed by **Raphael Geloen** for a student project at **HETIC**. If you want to learn more about him, follow him on [Twitter](https://twitter.com/R_Gln?lang=fr) !

# How to launch me ?

You just have to put me in your **localhost folder**, then launch it !
*Simple, isn't it ?*

# I'm using these API'S to work :

Cumulus is using two API's to work : [openweathermap](https://openweathermap.org/api) and [teleport](https://developers.teleport.org/api/) !

## Openweathermap

I'm using Openweathermap in order to access to data for detailled weather of today for a city, or for the weather forecast of this city.

## Teleport

The Teleport API brings to me tons of data about the city that you asked for, especially scores for Housing, Security, Business implants etc.
*You really have to check it out !*

# Main features

I have been developped by  a PHP beginner, so there is a lot to improve, but here are the features that I have :

## Correct City Check

In order to give Openweathermap API a correct city name, it must be in english, and can't have numbers or too much characters in it. I handle that, don't worry.
Of course, Openweathermap doesn't record all of the city in the world, so I'm taking care of you with telling you if a city isn't recorded by the API !
*No need to say thanks !*

## Cool data

I got everything you want ! Temperatures, wind, forecast, weather icons to resume, rising and setting sun hours, a lot of data on the cities !
*Trust me, I'm an engineer.*

## Responsive

At least, I'm trying to be.

# Ways for improvement

I will soon do an AJAX request in order to make the result page appear with an animation. I'm using AJAX because of the asynchronously action of the submit/reload.
*I'm so cool.*


# Thanks !
